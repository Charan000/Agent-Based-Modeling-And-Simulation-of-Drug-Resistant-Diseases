# Agent-Based-Modeling-And-Simulation-of-Drug-Resistant-Diseases-

The model aims to
mimic the realistic development of drug resistance in bacteria by considering disease
spread and drug-resistance as the cause for drug resistance. Subsequently, we aim
to observe different patterns of how TB spreads.
