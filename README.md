# Agent-Based-Modeling-And-Simulation-of-Drug-Resistant-Diseases

This agent-based model was developed to study the onset of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The model uses RepastCity to simulate human movements on GIS-based urban enviroments and simulates subsequent spread of the disease.
Our model was able to implicate interesting findings such as differences between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible diseases.
